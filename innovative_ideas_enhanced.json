Imagine a sneaker whose twin shows its lifecycle: from raw materials, through the factory, to a runner's feet—updating in real-time with sustainability metrics. Stadiums could have twins that simulate crowd flow, sound design, and merchandising layouts before events. Supply chains could be visualized as organic, branching rivers of goods.",
